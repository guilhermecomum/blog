#+Title: Minimalist Android Setup

Doesn't matter which android phone I'm using, I always do the same thing after initial setup:
- Install [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ginlemon.flowerfree&hl=pt_BR][Smart launcher]]
- Load my configurations

I love minimalist and practical interfaces, is important to remember that is practical for *me* (I hope this post help you to find your practical way)
There is 2 key points I really link on Smart Launcher the first one is that you are free to customize almost anything and the second one is it's automatically
organize you apps my category and is easy to find by initial letter.

This is my home screen:


[[It's clean, it's beautiful, it's handy!
